#SoulSync â€“ Journaling, Mood Tracking and Habit Monitoring App

SoulSync is a full stack personal wellness web application that empowers users
to reflect, track, and grow each day. It offers a calming space where users can 
write short daily journal entries, select their mood, and check off healthy habits
like drinking water, meditating, or reading. Each entry is stored securely and 
visualized through simple, beautiful charts to show weekly mood trends, journal
consistency, and habit progress. A motivational quote and thoughtful prompt appear
daily to encourage reflection and emotional well-being. With user authentication,
personalized data, and a soothing interface, SoulSync blends self-care with modern 
web development practices. Ideal for mental wellness and habit formation, this 
project demonstrates the power of meaningful software for real-world impact.
